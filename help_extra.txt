Depricated/mystery options
==================
-pre              Don't produce post-fit residuals
-model            DEPRICATED... doesn't do anything
-newfit           DEPRICATED... doesn't do anything
-trimonly         ?? Additional option for -setdm
-veryfast         Do not iterate SSB/dm computations (seems bad)
-last             ?? Something to do with fitwaves
-oldfit           DEPRICATED... doesn't do anything
-simuilate        ?? Injects a sinusoid into all pulsars
-setdm            ?? Some complicated way of setting DM for each ToA
